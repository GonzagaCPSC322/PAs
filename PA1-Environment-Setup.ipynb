This file contains \"the data scraped comprises a comprehensive list of tv shows available on various streaming platforms.\" It has the following columns (AKA attributes):\n",
    "1. Unique TV show ID\n",
    "1. Title\n",
    "1. Year: The year in which the tv show was produced\n",
    "1. Age: Target age group\n",
    "1. IMDb: IMDb rating\n",
    "1. Rotten Tomatoes: Rotten Tomatoes %\n",
    "1. Netflix: Whether the tv show is found on Netflix\n",
    "1. Hulu: Whether the tv show is found on Hulu\n",
    "1. Prime Video: Whether the tv show is found on Prime Video\n",
