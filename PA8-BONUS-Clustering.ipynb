    "## Overview and Requirements\n",
    "This assignment involves implementing a k-means clusterer. It has two main parts:\n",
    "1. `mysklearn`: Test and implement a general and re-usable unsupervised learning algorithm for k-means clustering\n",
    "1. Spotify Songs Dataset Mining (pa8.ipynb): Write a Jupyter Notebook that uses `mysklearn` to perform clustering tasks on a Spotify songs dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "I highly encourage you to design functions that are generic and re-usable for future programming assignments and data mining tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we are learning data science from scratch! The only non-standard Python libraries you should need to use for this assignment are `tabulate`, `numpy` (math functions, random number generation, etc.), and `scipy` (sparingly). This means that beyond these libraries, you should not `pip install` any additional libraries beyond what is included in the [continuumio/anaconda3:2024.06-1](https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/anaconda3) Docker image and you should not use `pandas/sklearn/`etc...

    "We are going to cluster songs in a Spotify song dataset and see if the clusters formed seem to correspond to music genres. I preprocessed and trimmed the original dataset to form the dataset we will use, songs.csv. Please see the [original dataset's description on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siropo/spotify-multigenre-playlists-data) and the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-several-audio-features) for details on the song attributes in the dataset. At a minimum, remove the categorical attributes of \"Artist Name\", \"Track Name\", \"Genre\" before clustering. When I made the songs.csv, I kept the first two for their for context about a song, and I kept \"Genre\" so you could investigate how the various genres get distributed among your clusters. There are seven genres with 100 randomly sampled songs from each genre.\n",

For reproducible results, set your algorithm's `random_state` (you can/should try different values of this). Create a chart showing the clusters' TSS for each value of k. Add a vertical line and/or annotation for your k = 7 results (because there are 7 genres). Is there an \"elbow\" point signifying a clear best number of clusters? Does this match the supposed 7 genres represented in the dataset? Based on this chart, choose a number of clusters to work with for step 2.\n",
