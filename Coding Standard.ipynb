    "# Coding Standard\n",
    "This document outlines the expectations of code organization and style for CPSC 322. Python code written in this course should adhere to the following guidelines, which are based on the [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [Google Style Python Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Names\n",
    "Source files (.py and .ipynb files) should have a name that describes your program. For example, a Python program to compute the area of various shapes could be called `area.py` instead of a non-informative name, such as `program.py`. For labs, it is recommended you name your python files for each task, e.g. `lab1task1.py`. For data assignments, the assignment specification will state what to name your source file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input/output files (e.g. .txt files, .csv files, etc.) should have a name that describes the content of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programmer-Defined Identifiers\n",
    "Variables, functions, and classes should be named informatively. For example, do not name a variable, `variable`. The name should describe the value of the variable (i.e. `radius` for storing the radius of a circle), computation performed by the function (i.e. `compute_circumference()` to compute the circumference of a circle), or the semantics of the class (i.e. `Circle` to represent information and functionality related to circles). Thoughtful identifier names improves the readability of your code to yourself and others. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "Liberally comment your code! It helps you and others who may read your code. Also, should you use an algorithm, idea, or any other content that is not your own, use comments in your code to properly **cite your sources**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inline Comments\n",
    "To describe the purpose of a line of code, it is beneficial to place comments throughout your code, not just when defining functions and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source File Comments\n",
    "Begin programs with a header section that indicates\n",
    "* Programmer's name\n",
    "* The course (\"CPSC 322\") \n",
    "* Assignment number (e.g., \"Programming Assignment #1\")\n",
    "* Date of current version\n",
    "* **Did you attempt the bonus?**\n",
    "* Brief description of what program does\n",

    ">Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce a coding standard and looks for code smells. It can also look for certain type errors, it can recommend suggestions about how particular blocks can be refactored and can offer you details about the code's complexity.\n",
