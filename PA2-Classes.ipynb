    "### Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with `mypytable.py`\n",
    "Read through the provided `mypytable.py` module to understand the state and behavior of a `MyPyTable`. Read the method docstrings carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Implement and Test `MyPyTable` Methods\n",
    "For each `MyPyTable` method with a `TODO`:\n",
    "1. Implement the method according to the method's docstring\n",
    "1. \"Unofficially\" test your implementation by writing your own code to call that method with various inputs\n",
    "    * You can do this in `pa2.py`, or at the bottom of `mypytable.py` in a `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` condition\n",
    "    * Note: Because it can be difficult to understand failing unit test output, I strongly encourage you to do this step BEFORE running the provided unit tests (next step)\n",
    "1. \"Officially\" test your method for functional correctness by running the unit tests in `test_mypytable.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: passing the inner and outer join tests are the most challenging parts of this assignment. Please make sure you complete the \"Join Practice Problem\" on the Join Lab handed out in class and you understand the tracing both algorithms on all examples before starting the joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Write Code in `pa2.py` to Excercise `MyPyTable`\n",
    "Choose 2 small tables (that can be joined) to exercise the `MyPyTable` class with. You can use tables from the Join Lab, or make up your own. These tables can be hard-coded in `pa2.py` or loaded from files. At a minimum, you should write code to create a few `MyPyTable` objects to represent the table data, call `MyPyTable` methods (including the joins!), and display/confirm the results."

    "1. Submit this PAâ€™s associated assignment in Canvas to mark your PA as \"done\" and ready for grading. We will then pull your Github repo and grade your PA as soon as possible.
